SAM Rewritten for Linux
===

# Introduction

This is meant to be an equivalent to the popular program SAM Achievement Manager for Windows.
It's in a very early stage of development, and all contributions are welcome.

As of right now, all features are not implemented yet, but it can lock and unlock achievements.

Expect a lot of bugs and lacking features too.

Contributions are welcome!

Thanks :)

# Building

Just run ./make.sh. Makefiles? Never heard of it. Packaging? What's that?

To run it, launch ./bin/launch.sh

Once again, all contributions are VERY welcome, even though this code is already aging and very badly written.
